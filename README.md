# N-bodyPlanetorySystem

The goal of this project is to simulate a N-body system with moons, planets, and a sun using the Forward Euler method.  My code would randomly select a planet to have one to three moons.  The moons would orbit around the planet and the planets would orbit around the sun. 

In this project, you will find below files:
1. Source code in matlab
2. Project documentation and explanation of source code in detail.
